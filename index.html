    <p><em>A Student</em></p>
    <p>I am a student in the last year of her teenage, who is figuring out what is that one thing or maybe more than one thing that she will love doing.
      It gets confusing at times , I mean i dont know like, I want to do something related to fashion but to be practical, I know that where I am
    right now , I dont have enough resources to experment with clothing, fashion , styling and makeup and I also am quite sure that this is not the
  only one thing that I would enjoy doing , so maybe I can save this for sometime later but really soon in my life . Till then I will have to do what
I can do here and do it effectively so that it takes me closer to my fashion thing? Makes sense maybe </p>
    <p>Now lets talk about my experience with coding. So it's been more than two months that I have been doing this course quite inconsistently tho , but
    trust me it was boring at the begining I used to sleep sometimes in front of my laptop , but when the designing part came , I sort of started enjoying
    the course and now the website part is even more interesting but I am not completely sure about the fact that this is that one thing but ya I am ready to
    be patient and I have stopped thinking that what I am doing right now is going to be the thing i continue doing the rest of my life, Thanks
